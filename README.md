# Overview
A friend of mine told me to learn something you need to do three things " learn , practice , repeat".
The idea is to gain great experience in dealing with different architectures, I started this journey two years ago to examine the common iOS architectures and implement them to develop a blog app

# iOS Architectures
- [x] **MVP**
- [x] **MVVM-C**
- [x] **MVVM-C + RxSwift**
- [x] **VIPER**

## To implement in the future
- **MVC**
- **Clean Architecture**
- **MVVM-C + Combine**
- **VIPER + RxSwift**
